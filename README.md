# üöÄ CodeSqueeze - A CLI tool to seamlessly upload any codebase to your preferred chatbot.

![CodeSqueeze Banner](https://github.com/cyberytti/CodeSqueeze/blob/main/assets/CodeSqueeze_image.png)

## ü§î Have you ever tried to upload an entire codebase to a chatbot, and hit the context limit error? üò©
**CodeSqueeze is the answer!** It intelligently scans your project, bundles all your source code into a single, optimized text file, and gets it ready for any AI chatbot. üåü Provide full project context to models like Qwen, Claude, or GPT with zero hassle. ‚ú®

## üåê How It Works?

CodeSqueeze combines these three essential elements in the output text file:

‚úÖ **System prompt**  
üìÅ **Project tree structure**  
üíª **Only the source (code) files**

By stripping away everything else‚Äîdocs, binaries, configs, tests, etc.‚Äîit keeps the prompt within token limits while still giving the chatbot a complete, uncluttered view of the codebase. üßπ

## üíé Features

1. ### üìÅ Include Only Source Code Files
If you want to include only the source code files, just provide the project path without any other instructions.

```bash
python3 CodeSqueeze.py "your project path"
```

This will give you three things:  
üìä the list of files included in the output file  
üìè the output file size in MB  
üî¢ and the estimated token count for that file.

---

2. ### üìÑ Add Other File Types
If you want to add other file types like txt, md, or anything else, use the `-e` parameter with the file type (without the dot), such as txt, md, yaml, etc.

```bash
python3 CodeSqueeze.py "your project path" -e "txt" -e "yaml" ...
```

This command will include all txt and yaml files in the output file. üìÇ

3. ### üö´ Exclude Specific Files from a Type
If you want to include a certain type of file but exclude one or two specific files from that type, use the `-i` parameter.

```bash
python3 CodeSqueeze.py "your project path" -e "txt" -i "requirements.txt"
```

This command will include all txt files except requirements.txt. üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

---

4. ### üéØ Include Specific Files Without Their Type
If you want to include just one or two specific files without adding their entire file type, use the `-f` parameter.

```bash
python3 CodeSqueeze.py "your project directory" -f "the selected file" -f "another selected file"...
```

This command will add those specific files to the output file. üéØ

---

5. ### üìã Copy Output as a Prompt to Clipboard
This tool usually creates a txt file that you can upload to any chatbot and discuss with it, but if you want to copy the output txt file as a prompt straight to your clipboard, use the `-c` parameter.

```bash
python3 CodeSqueeze.py "your project path" -c
```

This command will create a prompt and copy it to your clipboard automatically. üñ±Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏èüìã
